# --- sandbox identity pool ---------------------------------------------------

# makes a job's 0700 working directory genuinely private: with one shared uid every
# job could read every other job's source and rewrite it before it ran.
# Runtimes that resolve getpwuid (the JVM derives user.name this way) need real
# passwd entries, written directly here rather than with 32 useradd calls.

# The service itself runs as root on purpose: it must chown each job directory to
# that job's uid and setuid the compiler/runtime child. The security boundary is
# the child, not the service. Adding `USER runner` here would silently disable
# privilege dropping and leave user code running as root, so it is called out
# rather than left as an apparent oversight.
#
# There is deliberately no HEALTHCHECK here: it would require curl or wget in the
# image, and Render already health-checks /health over HTTP. Adding a network
# client purely for a healthcheck would enlarge the attack surface for no gain.
